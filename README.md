# simpleRelativitySimulator
attempt to simulate a real world

current features:
-energy spread(currently doesn't take into account energy pressure from neighbour cells)
-matter generation(hardcoded to 2^8 energy quantum)

features goal:
-inflation in early stage of evolution
-black holes support(so big masses of matter that gravity stops energy spred from them)
-gravity between particles of matter
-matter dynamics(solves impossibility of energy spread)
-actual relativity\
-matter to energy(afterlife of a matter)
